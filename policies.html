                                    <li><p>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20) both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 2conditions require team benches to be on the same side of the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twentyyards one (1) way from the halfway line.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to locate its bench area.
